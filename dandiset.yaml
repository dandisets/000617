description: "Adaptive and coordinated behavior requires that an animal be able to
  make predictions about the near and even far future. This intuition that some neural
  computations should be ‘predictive’ in their character has a long history, starting
  with ideas about how the receptive field structure of retinal ganglion cells relate
  to the statistics of natural visual scenes. Ideas about predictive computation have
  been most influential in thinking about the function of the neocortex. Here, the
  relatively stereotyped local circuitry of the neocortex has long led to speculation
  that each local circuit might be carrying out a somewhat similar, fundamental computation
  on its specific inputs. In addition, the organization of sensory-motor pathways
  into hierarchies (e.g., V1, V2, V4, IT in the ventral visual stream) with stereotyped
  feedforward and feedback connections has motivated ideas about hierarchical predictive
  codes, where higher levels of the hierarchy send predictions down to the lower level
  that then compares its inputs against the predictions and only send the surprises
  up the hierarchy (such as in the work of Mumford, Rao & Ballard, and Friston). Despite
  the wide influence of ideas about predictive coding, there is relatively little
  experimental evidence that such computations occur in multiple cortical areas, perhaps
  serving as a ‘canonical computation’ of the neocortical microcircuit. Our experimental
  design is based on a Sequence Learning Experiment, in which head-fixed mice passively
  view sequences of three different natural movie clips (labeled ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’), each
  having a duration of 2 seconds. We begin with one recording session (day #0), where
  the movie clips are presented in random order along with a 2 second grey screen
  (labeled ‘X’). Each stimulus occurs a total of 525 times, allowing a thorough characterization
  of neural responses before any sequence learning has occurred. Next, there are 3
  recording sessions where the three movie clips are presented in a repeating temporal
  sequence, ABCABC…, for 500 times, in order to train the mouse’s brain. This training
  allows the mouse to potentially use the identity of the current movie clip predict
  the next movie clip. In addition, each sequence training session includes a period
  of random-order presentation, in order to assess changes in neural tuning during
  sequence learning. Finally, our last session (day #4) had stimuli presented in random
  order, allowing us to test more thoroughly how responses changed due to sequence
  learning.\n\nOur design uses 2-photon microscopy with eight simultaneously recorded
  fields-of-view. The fields-of-view will include both layer 2/3 and layer 4 as well
  as from multiple cortical areas: V1 (VISp), LM (VISl), AM (VISam), and PM (VISpm).
  The experiment used the Cux2-CreERTS2:Camk2a-tTa; Ai93(TITL-GCaMP6f) mouse line,
  which has expression in excitatory neurons of both layer 4 and 2/3."
